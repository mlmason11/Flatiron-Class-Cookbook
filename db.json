      "description": "Who doesn't love a fresh and easy chicken salad recipe? With the perfect blend of creamy and crunchy, this lunchtime staple can be enjoyed on its own, over greens or sandwiched between two slices of crusty bread. While you can buy premade varieties at the store, nothing tops the flavor of homemade chicken salad. It's also a yummy way to use up last night's leftover chicken.",
      "ingredients": "1/2 cup mayonnaise | 2 tablespoons sour cream | 1 tablespoon lemon juice | 4 cups shredded rotisserie chicken | 1 + 1/4 cups seedless red grapes, halved | 1/2 cup chopped pecans | 1/2 cup chopped celery | salt and pepper to taste | 1/4 cup chopped sweet onion, optional | lettuce leaves or whole wheat bread slices, optional",
      "allergens": "Eggs | dairy | tree nuts",
      "steps": "1. Start by mixing the first five ingredients together for a creamy sauce. The sour cream and lemon juice add a tangy kick to this chunky chicken salad. Whisk together the mayonnaise, sour cream, lemon juice, salt and pepper until fully combined, tasting as you go, then set aside. | 2. In a large bowl, mix together the shredded chicken, halved red grapes, chopped pecans and chopped celery. If using onion, add it along with your mayonnaise sauce. Toss to coat. | 3. Once your chicken salad is combined, serve with fresh homemade bread, mixed greens salad or whole-grain crackers. Store leftovers in a sealed container in the refrigerator right away.",

      "description": "This curry is a spicy one! Curries can be found all over the world, but green curry originates from central Thailand. In our time travelling through Thailand, we enjoyed curries for breakfast, lunch, and dinner without ever tiring of it. Green chillies are used to create the curry paste, so it packs quite a bit of heat along with its intense and bold flavours.",
