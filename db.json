            "description": "This curry is a spicy one! Curries can be found all over the world, but green curry originates from central Thailand. In our time travelling through Thailand, we enjoyed curries for breakfast, lunch, and dinner without ever tiring of it. The name 'green' curry comes from the colour of the dish, as green chillies are used to create the curry paste, so it packs quite a bit of heat along with its intense and bold flavours.This curry is a spicy one!
